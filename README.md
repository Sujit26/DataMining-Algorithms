# DataMining-Algorithms

These the three alogorithms for assiosation rule mining. I Implement these algorithms in python and tested in diffrent DataSet.

How to Run code

-> Choose dataSet and update the name in the file (inside main function)  
-> Python3 algorithm_name.py  
-> Enter minimum support in percentage (For eg: for 1% wrtie 0.01)  

I have writen a code for generation of fake data-set for grocerry
